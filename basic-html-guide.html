<!--Psuedo code: the document is an html file 
    
    Info: A doctype is simply a way to tell the browser the type of document it’s looking at.
          The doctype should always be the first item at the top of any HTML file.

  <head>

        Info:   The head element is used to define the head portion of the html file.

                This part of the file contains information related to the file,
                such: meta element, title element, link elements, etc. 

                The meta element defines the html file's metadata. 
                Metadata is the data (information) about data.
                Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
                Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), 
                search engines (keywords), and other web services.

    <meta charset="utf-8" />

    <!-- Pseudo code: This meta element declares that the ‘character-set’ that used in this page are the UFT-8 characters.
        
         Info : To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use.
                ASCII was the first character encoding standard. 
                ASCII defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet: 
                numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .

                ASCII, however, only encoded English characters, so if you used other languages 
                whose alphabet does not consist of English characters, 
                the text wouldn't be properly displayed on your screen. 

                UTF-8 was created to address ASCII's shortcomings 
                and as a result, it can translate almost every language in the world.

    <!-- Pseudo code: This meta element declares that the name of this page's author is in the content attribute. -->

    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML" />

    <!-- Psuedo code: This meta element declares that the keywords for this page are in the content attribute. 
    
         Info : This element provides all the keywords that are associated with your site. 
                
                Most people take advantage of the meta keywords field by stuffing 
                the code with a  high-volume keywords and phrases.

                Make sure that the keywords you select are relevant to the site.

                Don’t use more than about 10 meta keywords for a single page.

                Including misspellings in your keywords may indicate to search engines 
                that your page is relevant to the (misspelled) search query.

                Keyword variations and plurals are both useful to keep in mind, 
                as well as the more extensive and more specific phrases.

                Start by labeling each one according to two characteristics: topic and intent. 
                Topic is pretty self-explanatory.
                There are three types of intent:
                    Informational: When the user wants to learn more about a topic.
                    Navigational: When the user wants to go to a specific website or web page.
                    Transactional: When the user wants to buy something.

    <meta
      name="description"
      content="A basic html document that will be used for learning purposes."
    />

    <!-- Pseudo code: This meta element declares that the description of this page is in the content attribute.  
    
         Info:  
                This element provides a brief summary of a site. 
                Search engines such as Google often display 
                the meta description in search results, 
                which can influence click-through rates.
                
                Between 50–160 characters

                The meta description tag serves the function of advertising copy. 
                It draws readers to a website from the SERP, and thus is a very visible and important part of search marketing. 

                Google and other search engines bold keywords in the description when they match search queries. 
                This bold text can draw the eyes of searchers, 
                so you should match your descriptions to search terms as closely as possible.

                It's important that you write an original and unique meta description for each page.

                Don't include alphanumeric characters such as quotation marks, 
                because google cuts off that description at the quotation mark.

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <!-- Psuedo code: This meta element declares that the viewport of this page is in the content attribute. 
        
         Info:  The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.
            
                The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

                The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

                The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

    <!--  Psuedo code: This link element declares that this html page will be styled 
          with code that's written in the file style.css. 
        
          Info: Html only puts your content on the browser.
                The process of decorating your html content, is called styling.

                For example, if you want all your h1,h2,h3 elements to have the color red,
                and you want your p elements to have the color blue,
                then you will have write another type of code called CSS (cascading Style Sheets) 

                We will learn about this code later on.
                For now, you only need to understand that this type of code
                is responsible for styling (i.e, decorating) your html content. 
                
                Colors, text sizes, image sizes, are all defined in css code. 
                
                Generally, its good practice to write your css in a different file.

                This file is :
                described -> stylesheet (because it contains your custom styles)
                named - >style.css (the extension css identifies that this file is a stylesheet)

                So if you have a file called style.css in your project
                then then browser will know that this file contains css (custom styles).
                
                After writing your css code in the file style.css 
                You will have to connect the style.css file to your html file.
                
                Generally, the link element connects your html file to other files.

                So for this line of code, 
                the link element declares that a stylesheet will be connected to this html file.
                This location of this stylesheet is in the href.
        
    -->

    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Quicksand:wght@500&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />

    <!-- Psuedo code: This link element declares that: 
         this html page will use fonts from google fonts api
         the name of the font is quicksand
         and the specifc elements which will use this font, will be identified in the stylesheet.
      
         Info:  There are various types of font styles. 
                If you want to find a font type for your website,
                then https://fonts.google.com/ is a good place to start. 
                
                When you find a specific font type that you like,
                you have to connect it to your html page.

                Generally, the link element connects your html file to other files.

                For this project we chose the font type name quicksand.
                
                Through the href, we connect the google fonts website to our html page,
                and then in the stylesheet (which is the file style.css)
                we will identify which elements will have this quicksand font style.
